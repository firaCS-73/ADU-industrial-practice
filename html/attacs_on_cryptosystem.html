          <h1>Attacks On Cryptosystems</h1>
          <p>
              Attacks are typically categorized based on the action performed by the attacker. An attack, thus, can be passive or active.
          </p>
          
          <h2>Passive Attacks</h2>
          <p>The main goal of a passive attack is to obtain <b>unauthorized access to the information</b>.<br>
              For example, actions such as intercepting and eavesdropping on the communication channel can be regarded as passive attack.<br>
          </p>   
          <p>
            These actions are passive in nature, as they neither affect information nor disrupt the communication channel. A passive attack is often seen as stealing information. The only difference in stealing physical goods and stealing information is that theft of data still leaves the owner in possession of that data. Passive information attack is thus more dangerous than stealing of goods, as information theft may go unnoticed by the owner.

          <h2>Active Attacs</h2>
          <p>
              An active attack involves changing the information in some way by conducting some process on the information. For example,
          </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Modifying the information in an unauthorized manner.</li>
                <li>Initiating unintended or unauthorized transmission of information.</li>
                <li>Alteration of authentication data such as originator name or timestamp associated with information</li>
                <li>Unauthorized deletion of data.</li>
                <li>Denial of access to information for legitimate users (denial of service).</li>
           </ul>

          <p>Cryptography provides many tools and techniques for implementing cryptosystems capable of preventing most of the attacks described above.</p>
